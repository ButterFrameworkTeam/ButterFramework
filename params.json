Created by a beginner for beginners.\r\nSo everyone can code and script. I just made that more easier to do.\r\nYou can now make your website easily and for rapid prototyping!\r\n\r\nButterFramework is written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nButterFramework supports (IE6+ in downgraded mode) IE9+ | Firefox 20+ | Safari 9 | Firefox OS (beta support) | Chrome 28+\r\n<br />\r\n###### BUTTERFRAMEWORK IS CURRENTLY IN ACTIVE DEVELOPPMENT, DO NOT USE IT ON HUGE PROJECTS. \r\n###### PLEASE USE IT FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.\r\n\r\n===================\r\n## Setting up the framework\r\n\r\nFirst, download the [current version](https://github.com/Buttershy/ButterFramework/archive/master.zip) of the framework, then drop all the content in an empty directory.<br>\r\nTo have the full framework working, you need to install a Sass compiler :<br />\r\n[Koala GUI](http://koala-app.com/), [Scout](http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/), etc ...\r\n<br />\r\nOnce all is installed, run the compiler.<br>\r\nSelect the folder where is located the framework and click on 'Compile'. Just check where the ButterFramework CSS. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nIf you don't have any error: Congratulations! You can now use the framework!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> I have already created my website, can I still use the framework?\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can. Just add ButterFramework css on your website (located in bframework folder).\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> Can I modify a little bit the framework?\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> Can I create my ButterFramework based framework?\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A:</strong> Yes but don't forget to give credit. :)\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> I want to contribute to the framework.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A:</strong> You are on Github, go ahead! \r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> Can I sell the framework?\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A:</strong> No! Except if your version is heavily modified and with our authorization (contact us if you need).\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Q:</strong> Can I remove the 'Use Butterframework'?\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A:</strong> Of course you can. :)\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nButterFramework is a project created/started and managed by Buttershy.<br />\r\nhttp://www.github.com/Buttershy\r\n\r\nTranslation help and correction by Serravir.
