# ButterFramework

### A very tiny HTML5 Framework

#### Let's create together!



====================

Butter Framework is an HTML5/CSS3 based website framework. Created by a beginner for beginners.
So everyone can code and script. I just made that more easier to do.
You can now make your website easily and for rapid prototyping!

ButterFramework is written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

ButterFramework supports (IE6+ in downgraded mode) IE9+ | Firefox 20+ | Safari 9 | Firefox OS (beta support) | Chrome 28+
<br />
###### BUTTERFRAMEWORK IS CURRENTLY IN ACTIVE DEVELOPPMENT, DO NOT USE IT ON HUGE PROJECTS. 
###### PLEASE USE IT FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.

===================
## Setting up the framework

First, download the [current version](https://github.com/Buttershy/ButterFramework/archive/master.zip) of the framework, then drop all the content in an empty directory.<br>
To have the full framework working, you need to install a Sass compiler :<br />
[Koala GUI](http://koala-app.com/), [Scout](http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/), etc ...
<br />
Once all is installed, run the compiler.<br>
Select the folder where is located the framework and click on 'Compile'. Just check where the ButterFramework CSS. 
<br /><br />
If you don't have any error: Congratulations! You can now use the framework!
