# ButterFramework

### A very tiny HTML5 Framework

#### Let's create together!



====================

Butter Framework is an HTML5/CSS3 based website framework. Created by a beginner for beginners.
So everyone can code and script. I just made that more easier to do.
You can now make your website easily!

ButterFramework is written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

ButterFramework supports (IE6+ beta) IE9+ | Firefox 20+ | Safari 9 | Firefox OS (beta support) | Chrome 28+

###### BUTTERFRAMEWORK IS CURRENTLY IN ACTIVE DEVELOPPMENT, DO NOT USE IT ON HUGE PROJECTS. 
###### PLEASE USE IT FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.

===================
## Setting up the framework

First, download the [current version](https://github.com/Buttershy/ButterFramework/archive/master.zip) of the framework, then drop all the content in an empty directory.<br>
To have the full framework working, you need to install a Less compiler (take the one you need for your system):<br />[Mac OS X](http://incident57.com/less/files/Less.zip) [Windows](http://winless.org/downloads/WinLess-1.8.3.msi) [Linux (x86)](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=c4glyJwmQ3gin6Uz5kqeK0) [Linux (x64)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/drive/share/179-0051775-1073453?ie=UTF8&s=c4glyJwmQ3gin6Uz5kqeK0) [Ubuntu (x86)](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=uPyHYhj3QpMmXwrmIOjU_w) [Ubuntu (x64)](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=AJfhBKi8Rccqn6j-2R9ctU)

Once all is installed, run the compiler.<br>
Select the folder where is located the framework and click on 'Compile'.
<br /><br />
If you don't have any error: Congratulations! You can now use the framework!
